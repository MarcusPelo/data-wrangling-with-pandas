# Data Wrangling with Pandas
This repository provides the data and an external resource in support of the course Data Wrangling with Pandas, provided by Cloud Academy.

## Data

The dataset we have used in this course is available in the `data` folder. I suggest to follow the following steps in order you to be able to replicate the course steps in your local host. Open your favourite terminal emulator, and then:

 1. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/cloudacademy/data-wrangling-with-pandas.git`
 2. create a python virtualenv: `mkvirtualenv - p python3 <NAME_ENV>`
 3. install the necessary requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 4. open a jupyter notebook by running: `jupyter notebook`

You are now ready to get your hands dirty: enjoy!

## Resources

The paper by Hadley Wickham is freely available at this stable [link](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf). I really recommend to read it!
